            <h2>Breif introduction</h2>
            <p>Puerto Rico is a tropical island, the beaches are beautiful and the people known as Boricuas can make your day with their jokes and history. The food is on another level no matter where you are going, but if you pass by a local of 'pinchos' (meat skewer) you must stop over there and try one you will never regret. Despite the storms that have passed through this beautiful island they stand up and recover once again showing resilience and perseverance keeping an outstanding place to visit.</p>

            <h2>Tropical challenge</h2>
            <p>Puerto Rico due to being a tropical Island they have storm season, in 2017 one Hurricane named 
                Maria category 5 was recognized as one of the strongest hurricanes to impact the island causing 
                a major humanitarian crisis and making damage cost of US$90 billion. The strongest hurricane category 
                5 that surpassed this was in 1928 hurricane San Felipe Segundo the only hurricane to strike Puerto Rico... 
                Puerto Rico has face several storms throughout the year
            <p>
            This hurricane history in Puerto Rica had started with the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the island in November 
            19th, 1493. Even though the island was "discovered" that year, the first Spanish settlement in Puerto Rico was established 
            years later by Juan Ponce de Le√≥n. This is the reason for having the first official records of tropical cyclones passing through 
            Puerto Rico in the first decade of the 1500s.
