        <h1>Hey!</h1>
        <img class="Mission" src="/boricua/images/misionerospr.jpg" alt="Misioneros en Aguadilla" style="height: 400px; width: 500px;">
        <p>My name is Laulin Vasquez I'm 22 years old, I'm from the Dominican Republic,
           I'm the oldest son in my family and the brother protector of Kevin and Erick.
           I served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
           in Puerto Rico for 2 years from 2019-2022 decision that I took when I was 18 
           years old has blessed my life. I learn how to love the people and serve them 
           as followers of Jesus Christ. I've been a member of the church of Jesus Christ 
           for more than 8 years since I was 13 years old. As a young my favorite hobbit is 
           playing basketball, I love to draw and visit new places. My peaceful place to 
           be is at the beach because I can think about what are the beautiful things in 
           life, I also love the mountains and the animals.

            <h1>Academic background:</h1>
            <p>Since I was a kid I have that strong desire to learn new things, school was always
                a places where I can learn and growth. When I turn to 16 years old I decided to study 
                in a technical school to become a technician in electronics. It was difficult at the beginning
                but I started to love what I was doing. I learned how hardwell components works and I created
                wonderful projects such as a little robot that follows the light.
