        <p>My name is Laulin Vasquez I'm 22 years old, I was born in the Dominican Republic, 
           currently living in Santo Domingo Oeste. The oldest son of Debora Yael Pe√±alo and Elmes
           Vasquez, the brother protector of Kevin and Erick. I growth around my friends playing 
           electronics game (as a nilenial boy) and practicing basketball. I'm a member of the
           Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
           I served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
           in Puerto Rico for 2 years from 2019-2022 decision that I took when I was 18 
           years old has blessed my life. I learn how to love the people and serve them 
           as followers of Jesus Christ. I've been a member of the church of Jesus Christ 
           for more than 8 years since I was 13 years old. As a young my favorite hobbit is 
           playing basketball, I love to draw and visit new places. My peaceful place to 
           be is at the beach because I can think about what are the beautiful things in 
           life, I also love the mountains and the animals.

            <h1>Academic background:</h1>
            <p>Since I was a kid I have had a strong desire to learn new things, school was always
                a place where I can learn and grow. When I turn to 16 years old I decided to study 
                in a technical school to become a technician in electronics. It was difficult initially,
                but I started to love what I was doing. I learned how Hardwell components work and I created
                beautiful projects such as a little robot that follows the light. One of my friends taught me about
                software and a little bit of programming language, he introduced me to learn how to use Arduino Uno
                even though I just learned simple things of code I was excited to continue on that path. Times flew and it 
                has been 4 years already since I graduated from High school, I took big decisions in my life that has blessed me. 
                My major is in web Design and Development at Brigham Young University Idaho.
