        <p>My name is Laulin Vasquez I'm 22 years old, I was born on August 17th, 2020 in the Dominican Republic, 
           currently living in Santo Domingo Oeste. The oldest son of Debora Yael Pe√±alo and Elmes
           Vasquez, the brother protector of Kevin and Erick. I growth around my friends playing 
           electronics game and practicing basketball. I'm a member of the
           Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
           I served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
           in Puerto Rico for 2 years from 2019-2022 decision that I took when I was 18 
           years old has blessed my life. I learn how to love the people and serve them 
           as followers of Jesus Christ. I've been a member of the church of Jesus Christ 
           for more than 8 years since I was 13 years old. As a young my favorite hobbit is 
           playing basketball, I love to draw and visit new places. My peaceful place to 
           be is at the beach because I can think about what are the beautiful things in 
           life, I also love the mountains and take pictures.

            <h2>Academic background:</h2>
            <p>Since I was a kid I have had a strong desire to learn new things. I ponder about how things work
                such as the computer, stove, or the television. To me someone that creates things like the computer or little
                things referred to them as genius. This is why school was always my beginning of everything, it was
                a place where I can learn and grow. When I turn to 16 years old I decided to study 
                in a technical school to become a technician in electronics. It was difficult initially,
                but I started to love what I was doing. I learned how Hardwell components work and I created
                beautiful projects such as a little robot that follows the light. One of my friends taught me about
                software and a little bit of programming language, he introduced me to learn how to use Arduino Uno
                even though I just learned simple things of code I was excited to continue on that path. I knew to keep
                growing in that path I must learn English, that was my goal after finishing high school. Knowing that learing
                a new language is a challenge I decided to tak it.

            <p>Times flew and it 
                has been 4 years already since I graduated from High school, I took big decisions in my life that has blessed me. 
                My major now is in web Design and Development at Brigham Young University Idaho online. It seems to be a challenge being 
                an online student but I remember that I've been getting closer of my goal as I continue pressing forward with faith.
