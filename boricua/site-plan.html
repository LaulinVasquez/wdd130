      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>

         places to visit in Puerto Rico such as beaches, plazas (where people get together), the highway
         view, and their culture. Puerto Rico has been involved in difficult storms but they recovered as
         a big family. This will be an example of how Puerto Ricans stand up and smile against difficulties.

        Puerto Rico is a tropical island, the beaches are beautiful and the people known as Boricuas can make
        your day with their jokes and history. The food is on another level no matter where you are going, but if you pass
        by a local of 'pinchos' (meat skewer) you must stop over there and try one you will never regret. Despite the storms that have passed through 
        this beautiful island they stand up and recover once again showing resilience and perseverance keeping an outstanding place to visit.

         love the mountains and the animals.
